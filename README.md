# Gene regulatory network inference from scRNA-seq data

This pipeline details how to reconstruct the underlying transcriptional regulatory network of nervous system development using a tree-based method GENIE3.

First we retrieve the regulatory relationships between genes from the scRNA-seq data. 
And then we reconstruct the network using Cytoscape.
